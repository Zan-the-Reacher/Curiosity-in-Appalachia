### **Session 1: Automating Tasks with Power Automate and Outlook**
**Objective:** Automate processes in Outlook using Power Automate to streamline your workflow.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Sign in to Power Automate:**

2. **Create a New Flow:**
   - Click on **Create** from the left menu.
   - Select **Automated Flow** for automatic triggers, or **Instant Flow** for manually triggered actions.
   - Choose a template or start from scratch. To start with Outlook, click on **"When a new email arrives"** under Outlook triggers.

3. **Set Trigger for Incoming Emails:**
   - Choose the **"When a new email arrives"** trigger. This will activate the flow whenever a new email is received in your Outlook inbox.
   - Configure the trigger to focus on specific folders (e.g., Inbox) or apply filters (e.g., from specific senders or with certain keywords in the subject).

4. **Add Actions (e.g., Move Emails to a Folder):**
   - After setting the trigger, click **New Step**.
   - Search for **Outlook** actions like **Move email** or **Flag email**.
   - Choose **Move email** and select a folder to automatically move emails based on your condition (e.g., move emails from a specific client or with certain keywords to a designated folder).

5. **Additional Action (Optional):**
   - You can add more actions like sending an automatic reply, adding a task to Microsoft To-Do, or creating a calendar event.
   - Example: **Send an email** to your Outlook account whenever an email with a specific subject arrives.

6. **Test the Flow:**
   - Once you finish configuring your flow, click on **Save** and **Test** the flow by sending an email that matches your condition.
   - Check if the flow works by verifying the moved email or received task.

7. **Monitor and Edit:**
   - You can monitor the flow's execution by going to **My flows** and viewing the run history. You can edit the flow anytime if needed.

5. **Set Up Event Display:**
   - Inside the **Gallery**, bind the data to **Outlook Calendar** so that your events appear dynamically.
   - To do this, set the **Items** property of the Gallery to `Office365Outlook.CalendarGetEvents()`.
   - Display key event details such as date, time, subject, and location.

6. **Add Functionality (Create Events):**
   - Add input fields for creating new events. Use **Text Input** for the event title and date, and **Date Picker** for selecting the date and time.
   - Add a **Submit** button that triggers an action to create a new event in your Outlook calendar using the **Office365Outlook.CalendarCreateEvent** function.

7. **Publish and Test:**
   - Click on **Play** to test the app and ensure it pulls data correctly from your Outlook calendar.
   - If everything works, click **File > Publish** to share the app.

8. **Monitor and Edit:**
   - Once published, you can use the app on your mobile device or desktop.
   - You can edit the app anytime from the Power Apps portal.

### **Session 3: Analyzing Outlook Email Data with Power BI**
**Objective:** Create a Power BI dashboard to visualize email data from Outlook.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Sign in to Power BI:**
   - Go to [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) and sign in using your Microsoft account.

2. **Get Data from Outlook:**

   - Choose the data you want to import, such as emails, calendar events, and contacts.

3. **Load Data into Power BI:**
   - Once you've selected your data (e.g., inbox data), click **Load**.
   - Power BI will import the data, which you can now work with.

4. **Transform Data (Optional):**
   - Click **Transform Data** to clean and filter the email data.
   - For example, you can filter emails by date range, subject, sender, or attachment status.

5. **Create Visualizations:**
   - Drag and drop fields onto the report canvas to create different types of visualizations. Example:
     - **Bar charts** showing the number of emails received per day or per sender.
     - **Pie charts** showing the distribution of emails by folder or priority.
     - **Line charts** showing email volume over time.

6. **Create Email Analytics (Example):**
   - You can create a **card visualization** to show the total number of unread emails in your inbox.
   - Add a **table** showing the list of emails with important metadata like sender, subject, and received date.

7. **Publish and Share:**
   - Once your report is complete, click on **Publish** to upload it to the Power BI Service.
   - You can share your report with others or set up automatic data refresh if you want to track email trends over time.

8. **Set Up Alerts and Monitor:**
   - In the Power BI Service, you can set up alerts on certain metrics. For example, if you want to be notified when you receive more than 50 emails in a day, set up a threshold and receive an email notification.
