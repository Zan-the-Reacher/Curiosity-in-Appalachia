Here's a multi-pronged approach that reflects commitment to AI and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) literacy, community empowerment, scientific research, and national-level innovation. The focus would be on delivering real-world, measurable impact—especially in HUBZone and Appalachian communities—while building a sustainable ecosystem of scientific education, research, and entrepreneurship.
