# MEL Plan

To monitor, evaluate, and prove the effectiveness of your workshops (or any program), you need a **Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) Plan**. Here's a step-by-step guide to creating and implementing one, including pre- and post-assessments:

---

### **1. Define Objectives and Success Metrics**
   - **What are you trying to achieve?** Clearly outline the goals of your workshops. For example:
     - Increase participants' understanding of the ANDROID Ops framework.
     - Enable participants to apply the framework using LLMs in their organizational contexts.
   - **Set measurable success metrics**:
     - Percentage of participants who can map their processes using the framework.
     - Number of actionable insights generated using LLMs.
     - Participant satisfaction scores from feedback forms.

---

### **2. Pre-Assessment (Before the Workshop)**
   - **Purpose**: Gauge participants' baseline knowledge and expectations.
   - **How to Conduct**:
     - Use a short survey or quiz to assess their familiarity with the ANDROID Ops framework and LLMs.
     - Example questions:
       - "Have you used LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot) before? If yes, how?"
       - "Rate your understanding of process mapping on a scale of 1-5."
       - "What challenges do you face in your current workflows?"
   - **Tools**: Google Forms, Typeform, or any survey tool.

---

### **3. Monitoring During the Workshop**
   - **Observe Engagement**:
     - Track how participants interact with LLMs during the mapping activity.
     - Note the quality and relevance of the insights generated by LLMs.
   - **Facilitator Feedback**:
     - Have facilitators take notes on participant engagement, questions asked, and challenges faced during the session.

---

### **4. Post-Assessment (After the Workshop)**
   - **Purpose**: Measure knowledge gained and collect feedback on the workshop's effectiveness.
   - **How to Conduct**:
     - Use a post-workshop survey or quiz to assess learning outcomes.
     - Example questions:
       - "What is the ANDROID Ops framework, and how can it be applied in your organization?"
       - "What insights did you generate using the LLM? How will you implement them?"
       - "Rate the workshop on a scale of 1-5 in terms of usefulness."
   - **Compare Results**:
     - Compare pre- and post-assessment results to measure knowledge improvement.

---

### **5. Collect Qualitative Feedback**
   - **Participant Reflections**:
     - Ask participants to share their experiences using LLMs during the workshop.
     - Example prompt: "Describe one actionable insight you gained from the workshop and how you plan to implement it."
   - **Facilitator Observations**:
     - Document common challenges or areas where participants struggled.

---

### **6. Evaluate and Analyze**
   - **Quantitative Analysis**:
     - Calculate the percentage improvement in knowledge based on pre- and post-assessment scores.
     - Analyze satisfaction scores and engagement metrics.
   - **Qualitative Analysis**:
     - Identify recurring themes in participant feedback.
     - Highlight success stories or innovative uses of the ANDROID Ops framework and LLMs.

---

### **7. Reporting and Sharing Results**
   - **Create a Summary Report**:
     - Include key findings, success metrics, and participant feedback.
     - Highlight areas for improvement and next steps.
   - **Share Results**:
     - Share the report with stakeholders (e.g., funders, organizational leaders) to demonstrate the workshop's impact.

---

### **8. Continuous Learning and Improvement**
   - **Iterate Based on Feedback**:
     - Use participant feedback to refine future workshops.
     - For example, if participants struggled with LLM prompts, include a mini-session on effective prompt engineering.
   - **Follow-Up**:
     - Conduct follow-up surveys 1-3 months after the workshop to assess long-term impact.
     - Example questions:
       - "Have you implemented the ANDROID Ops framework in your organization? If yes, how?"
       - "What challenges have you faced since the workshop?"

---

### **Additional Tips**
   - **Pre- and Post-Workshop Artifacts**:
     - Collect artifacts like screenshots of LLM-generated insights or completed process maps to showcase participant progress.
   - **Use Technology**:
     - Tools like Mentimeter or Kahoot can make assessments interactive and engaging.
   - **Incorporate Real-Time Feedback**:
     - Use live polls or chat features during the workshop to gauge understanding and adjust on the fly.

By implementing this MEL plan, you can effectively monitor and evaluate your workshops, proving their impact and identifying areas for improvement.
